#Modulo and "Modulus" operator
print(10 % 3) # Outputs 1 because 10 divided by 3 leaves
# a remainder of 1
print(10 % 2) # Outputs 0 because 10 divided by 2 leaves

print(2 ** 8)
# Outputs 256 because 2 to the power of 8 is 256
print(6*6)

#Variable Assignment
#Example
#Python uses Dynamic Typing
#this means you can reassign variables to diff data types.
#This makes python very flexible in assigning datatypes, this is different than other language that are staticaly typed
#Example
my_dogs = 2
#my_dogs = ["Sammy", "Frankie"]
print(my_dogs)
#print(my_dogs + my_dogs)
print(type(my_dogs))
